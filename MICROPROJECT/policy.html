        <p class="style5" style="user-select: auto;"><strong style="user-select: auto;">1. Placement Policy for Recruiting  Organizations: AY 2019-2020 </strong><br style="user-select: auto;">
The T&amp;P  Cell, Government Polytechnic, Yavatmal welcomes all recruiting organizations to  take active part in the Placement Process during the year 2019-20.
